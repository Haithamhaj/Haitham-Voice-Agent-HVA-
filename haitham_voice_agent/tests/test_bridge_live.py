I wanted to share our preliminary thoughts on the Q2 2025 roadmap for Mind-Q.

Key Points:
1. Database Migration: We've decided to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for better time-series support.
2. AI Features: Planning to integrate advanced memory capabilities using vector embeddings.
3. Mobile App: iOS beta launch scheduled for April 2025.

Action Items:
- Sarah: Lead the database migration planning
- Ahmed: Research vector database options
- Haitham: Prototype the memory system

Let's discuss this in our next sync meeting.

Best,
Sarah
